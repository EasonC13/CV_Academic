Moreover, he is enthusiastic about learning techniques and applications of Education, AI, NLP, and Blockchain. Therefore, he has developed quite a few applications that impressed me, examples including an embedding-based move recommender via LINE chatbot (with similar movies in 2-D visualized graph in the LINE chatbot interface), not only duplicating our research output (an emotional chatbot system) but also improving the system by allowing multiple responses with a solid evaluation experiment, and an edge-computing based eye-tracking and emotional face recognition system applied in an online learning scenario to improve individual's self-regulated learning.\n\n He did not only develop application systems quickly but also evaluated their use in practical applications based on what he learned in his major, i.e., Learning Science, which often integrates the knowledge from psychology, .human behavior, advanced statistics, and information technology.\n\n He also devoted himself to scientific paper writing and therefore has several papers accepted in refereed international conferences. I have never heard of any undergraduate students in Taiwan who could have more than 7 papers accepted before their graduation, except Eason.\n\n I would like to keep him beside me to do more research and develop more exciting applications in NLP, AI, or education. However, I also wish him to go outside to experience a broader career opportunity which I believe will benefit us all, as he is able to do something useful in academics and industrial sectors.\n\n`,
